# Transcription

For local/client-held media, import it through Desktop's `push_asset` tool, then use `browse_assets` to check whether transcription is available before transcript-dependent work.

Typical flow:

1. Use `browse_assets` to get the video/audio asset ID and transcript status.
2. If this is a fresh local import, make sure it is registered through Desktop's `push_asset` tool.
3. Call `track_progress` with `action:"wait"`, `target:"transcription"`, and `assetIds` set to the asset ID or prefix.
4. Use `find_transcript` to search transcript text and confirm word timestamps.
5. Use `edit_captions` action `enable` or `read_captions` as needed once transcription is ready.

Example:

```json
{
  "action": "wait",
  "target": "transcription",
  "assetIds": "13c1aa02cd"
}
```

Always use `track_progress` for transcription readiness when the asset reports a transcription job. Do not upload a Desktop-local asset to cloud storage merely to make transcription available; if the local workflow cannot start transcription, report that limitation instead of switching to an external import path.

Use `trigger_transcript` when the user explicitly wants an idle or failed transcription started. It reuses prepared transcription audio and otherwise asks Desktop to run its local audio preparation/upload pipeline. It is idempotent for complete, no-audio, and in-progress assets.

## Stuck Transcription And Retry

Do not declare transcription stuck from one non-terminal status. Base the decision on both asset length and the time the local CLI has actually waited in this task.

1. Use `browse_assets` and note the asset duration when available.
2. Start counting elapsed wait time from the first `track_progress` `action:"wait"` or from the earliest reliable in-task timestamp where Codex observed transcription as pending/running.
3. Treat `no_audio` / no-speech as a successful terminal analysis result: the media is usable, but there is no transcript to read or caption. Do not report it as a transcription failure or retry it unless the user says the media contains speech that should have been detected.
4. If transcription reports an explicit failed, errored, or timed-out terminal state, retry immediately after confirming the asset is a registered video/audio asset and its local source is still available.
5. If transcription remains pending/running with no failure, treat it as stuck only after elapsed wait time exceeds `max(5 minutes, min(60 minutes, 2 × asset duration))`. For example, wait at least 5 minutes for a 30-second clip, about 20 minutes for a 10-minute asset, and about 60 minutes for a 1-hour or longer asset.
6. If duration is unknown, wait at least 10 minutes across more than one `track_progress` call before treating it as stuck, unless the tool reports an explicit failure.

For an `idle` or explicitly failed (`error`) run, use `trigger_transcript` with the asset id/prefix. It does not wait for completion. If an in-progress run has genuinely exceeded the stuck threshold, use `manage_transcript` with `action:"retry_transcription"` because `trigger_transcript` intentionally leaves in-progress work unchanged. After triggering or retrying, call `track_progress` with `target:"transcription"`, `action:"wait"`, and the same asset id before reading transcripts or captions.

Example retry:

```json
{
  "action": "retry_transcription",
  "asset": "13c1aa02cd"
}
```

If captions read back as empty, check the source-time range of the timeline clip. A transcript can be ready while the current visible clip starts before the first spoken word; add or trim a clip so the transcribed source words fall inside the timeline range, then extend/update the captions item duration if needed.

Use the raw tools when you need finer control:

- `track_progress` with `target: "transcription"` for status/wait.
- `find_transcript` for query-based transcript lookup.
- `read_captions` and `edit_captions` for caption display edits.
- `manage_transcript` action `fix` for source transcript repair.
- `manage_transcript` action `retry_transcription` to force-retry ASR after a transcription is stuck, timed out, or failed.
- `clean_script` for mechanical timeline playback cleanup of fixed fillers and batch pauses after transcript-ready media is on the timeline.

When a transcript-ready request becomes an editorial talking-head edit, follow the public-safe talking-head workflow in shared `talking-head-guide`. In short: use `clean_script` only for mechanical cleanup, then use Script (`read_script` -> edit `timeline.md` -> `apply_script`) for semantic repeated-take, silence, filler, or coherence edits, and verify the resulting script rather than trusting tool success alone.
