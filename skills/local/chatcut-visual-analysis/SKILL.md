# Visual Analysis

Use this skill when visual evidence decides the answer: verifying an edit, comparing before/after states, finding when a visual change starts, checking layout or animation, or reviewing several source frames together.

## Time Coordinates

Keep the two time domains separate:

- `preview_timeline` with `views:["viewer"]` uses **timeline frame numbers**. Its result reports the actual rendered frame, timeline FPS, and timeline time; the image is returned inline. Exact frames must be before `durationInFrames` and, when a range is supplied, inside `[fromFrame,toFrame)`. `fromFrame` is valid; `toFrame` and `durationInFrames` are exclusive boundaries and are rejected instead of silently moving to another frame.
- `inspect_asset` uses `sourceTimesMs`, which are milliseconds in the **original source asset**. They do not include timeline placement, source trim, or playback rate. Trust the returned `sourceTimeMs` for each image.
- Never describe an asset source timestamp as a timeline timestamp. To relate a placed clip to its source, read that item's timeline start, source-start offset, playback rate, and timeline FPS first.

## Tools

### Timeline Composition

Call `preview_timeline` with `views:["viewer"]` to inspect the composed viewer output, including crops, overlays, captions, effects, and motion graphics. Effects or transitions applied directly to a Motion Graphic item are the current exception: the viewer renders the underlying MG without that shader, so confirm those cases in the user's editor. Request only the frames needed for the current comparison.

### Original Asset

Call `inspect_asset` with one video asset and either:

- `sourceFrameCount` for a coarse overview across the original asset.
- `sourceTimesMs` for exact source-media moments after narrowing.

Use `transcriptRangesMs` separately when bounded transcript context helps explain the visual moment. Do not use `inspect_asset` to claim what a placed timeline composition looks like.

## Narrowing A Change

Use coarse-to-fine sampling instead of requesting every frame:

1. Establish one frame before and one frame after the suspected change.
2. Sample 3-7 evenly spaced moments inside that interval.
3. Find the adjacent pair that brackets the first visible difference.
4. Repeat within that smaller interval until the boundary is exact enough; for timeline animation, stop at adjacent timeline frames when exact onset matters.
5. Inspect the full frames once before cropping. Then use the same crop rectangle on every comparison image to isolate the changing region without losing temporal alignment.

For a source asset, repeat the same process with `sourceTimesMs`. For a timeline, repeat it with frame numbers. Do not mix the coordinates during narrowing.

## Labeled Contact Sheets

The bundled helper concatenates workspace images without sending bytes back through the ChatCut API. It preserves argument order and burns labels into the result:

```bash
node .claude/skills/visual-analysis/scripts/concat-images.mjs \
  --output visual-analysis/timeline-change.jpg \
  --columns 3 \
  --caption "frame 120 | timeline 4.000s" \
  --caption "frame 123 | timeline 4.100s" \
  --caption "frame 126 | timeline 4.200s" \
  timeline-frames/frame-120.jpg \
  timeline-frames/frame-123.jpg \
  timeline-frames/frame-126.jpg
```

For a shared spatial region, pass ImageMagick crop geometry in pixels:

```bash
node .claude/skills/visual-analysis/scripts/concat-images.mjs \
  --output visual-analysis/title-region.jpg \
  --crop 900x420+510+120 \
  --caption "source 1250ms" \
  --caption "source 1500ms" \
  asset-frames/source-1250ms.jpg \
  asset-frames/source-1500ms.jpg
```

Options:

- `--output <path>` is required and must end in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.webp`.
- `--columns <1-9>` controls the grid; the default is approximately square.
- `--caption <text>` repeats once per input. If omitted, each tile uses its filename.
- `--crop <WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y>` applies the same pixel crop to every input.
- `--tile-width <pixels>` limits each tile width; default `720`.

Read the helper's JSON result, then use `Read` on its `outputPath`. Successful execution alone is not visual verification; inspect the resulting pixels before making a visual claim.

## Rules

- Label every comparison with the returned timeline frame/time or source-asset time. Do not rely on file order alone.
- Keep chronological order left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
- Build a contact sheet for comparison, not as a substitute for opening a full-resolution frame when small details matter.
- Render fresh evidence after an edit. Old workspace images prove the old state only.
- Temporary analysis files are not project assets. Use `push_asset` only when the user asks to keep or use one in the project.
