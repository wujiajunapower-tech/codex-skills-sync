# Credits & Plans

## What Are Credits

Credits are the currency for all AI-powered features in ChatCut. Every time the AI processes a request, credits are consumed.

**What uses credits:**

- AI conversation — chatting with the AI to edit and refine your video
- AI generation — creating videos, images, motion graphics, music, or voiceovers

**What does NOT use credits:**

- Browsing and previewing projects
- Manual editing (dragging, trimming, adjusting items on the timeline)
- Exporting your video
- Uploading media files

## Free Web Export Quota

Exporting does not spend AI credits, but free accounts have a separate allowance for web cloud exports:

- Free accounts can export up to 60 minutes of video through the web cloud exporter across all of their projects.
- The **Export** panel shows the exact live usage under **Web free export quota** as **Used [time] / 60:00**.
- If the next export would exceed the remaining allowance, ChatCut shows **Free export quota is insufficient** and **Upgrade and continue export**.
- An active paid subscription removes this web export limit. Buying a one-time credit pack adds AI credits but does not remove the export limit.

If a user says export failed with "insufficient balance" or asks whether export needs credits, explain this distinction first. Do not diagnose low AI credits or a ProRes requirement unless the visible export panel indicates that separate problem. The agent cannot read the user's live export usage, so guide them to **Export** -> **Web free export quota** for the source of truth.

## How Credits Are Consumed

There are two types of credit consumption:

### 1. Conversation

Every message you send to the AI assistant costs credits. The amount depends on:

- **Task complexity** — a multi-step editing task with many changes costs more than a simple question.
- **Conversation length** — the longer the conversation in a session, the more context the AI processes, which increases cost per message.
- **Project size** — larger projects with more clips and tracks require more context for the AI to understand.

Tips to use credits efficiently:

- Be specific and clear in your requests to reduce back-and-forth.
- Start a new project/session for unrelated tasks to keep context small.

### 2. Generation

Each generation task consumes credits independently. Approximate costs:

| Feature                       | Approximate Cost                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| AI video generation           | ~3 credits per 5-second clip      |
| AI image generation           | ~0.2 – 0.6 credits per image      |
| Motion graphics generation    | ~0.1 – 0.3 credits per generation |
| AI music generation           | ~0.12 credits per song            |
| AI voiceover (text-to-speech) | ~0.08 credits per second of audio |

These are approximate — actual costs may vary slightly depending on the complexity and output.

**Important:** Generation credits are only deducted after the generation succeeds. If a generation fails, no credits are consumed.

For Motion Graphics, Video Generation, and Image Generation, users may see a confirmation card in the AI chat area before the agent starts a generation that costs credits. Choosing **Allow all ... in this project** enables the matching **Generation Auto-Allow** switch for the current project only. To disable it later in that project, open **Agent Settings** from the bottom of the AI panel, next to the **Agent** mode selector, then open **Generation Auto-Allow**.

## Checking Your Balance & Usage History

Your current credit balance is visible near the profile avatar in the top-right user menu area. Open the profile menu to access Upgrade and credit/billing options.

To view your credit usage history, click your profile icon → **Credits history**. The dialog shows current credits, subscription status, and usage history by day, by type, or in full detail.

Guide users to the matching view for their question:

- **How many credits do I have left?** Check the available balance at the top of **Credits history**.
- **How many credits did I use?** Check **By Day** for daily totals or **By Type** for totals grouped by feature.
- **How many credits did the last action use?** Check **Detail** for the newest negative transaction. The same row shows the balance after that charge.
- **How many credits did a payment add?** Guide the user to the top-right avatar menu -> **Credits history** and the **Credits** table at the top. Payment amount alone is not enough to infer the result because the selected product, billing period, and promotion can differ.
- **How do I subscribe or buy more credits?** Use the top-right avatar menu -> **Upgrade** for ChatCut Pro. Active subscribers can use **Credits history** -> **Buy Credits** when that button is shown.

Do not estimate an exact live-account value from the task description, a dollar amount, or approximate generation pricing. Give the navigation above instead. A purchase adds credits; it is not itself credit usage.

## Payment Methods

ChatCut Pro checkout supports card and Alipay.

- Monthly ChatCut Pro paid with card or Alipay renews automatically.
- Annual ChatCut Pro paid with card renews automatically.
- Annual ChatCut Pro paid with Alipay covers one annual billing period and does not renew automatically.
- For credit packs, the checkout page is the source of truth for the payment methods available for that purchase.

When asked whether ChatCut supports Alipay, answer **yes** directly and explain the monthly-versus-annual renewal difference if relevant. Do not send the user to support for this question.

## Managing a Subscription

Open the top-right avatar menu -> **Credits history**. In the **Credit History** dialog, use the **Subscription** section:

- **Change Plan** opens the Upgrade dialog with the available plans.
- **Cancel Subscription** schedules cancellation for the displayed period-end date. Paid features remain active until that date.
- **Resume Subscription** reverses a scheduled cancellation before it takes effect.
- **Manage Payment** opens payment-method management; **Update Payment** is shown when a payment is past due.

Cancellation does not issue a refund. For a refund request or an incorrect charge, use **Feedback** from the avatar menu or email team@chatcut.io after giving the relevant self-service steps above.

Use these exact visible labels for the user's locale:

| English             | Chinese      | Spanish               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Upgrade             | 升级         | Actualizar            |
| Credits history     | 积分记录     | Historial de créditos |
| Subscription        | 订阅         | Suscripción           |
| Change Plan         | 更换套餐     | Cambiar plan          |
| Cancel Subscription | 取消订阅     | Cancelar suscripción  |
| Resume Subscription | 恢复订阅     | Reactivar suscripción |
| Manage Payment      | 管理支付     | Gestionar pago        |
| Update Payment      | 更新支付方式 | Actualizar pago       |
| Buy Credits         | 购买积分     | Comprar créditos      |

## Subscription Plans

### Pro

Pro is the paid subscription shown in the app. It includes a monthly credit allocation and unlocks premium features. The **Upgrade to ChatCut Pro** dialog shows the current credit tiers, monthly/annual billing options, discounts, and checkout methods, so use the in-app dialog as the source of truth for exact pricing.

Current subscription tiers are organized by monthly credits, starting at 100 credits/month and scaling up for heavier usage. Annual billing is available; the app displays the current annual discount or promotion at checkout.

**Pro features include:**
