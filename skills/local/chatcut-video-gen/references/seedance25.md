# Seedance 2.5

Read this document before generating with `model: "seedance-2-5"`, the default for `submit_video`.

## Capabilities

- Duration: 4-30 integer seconds via `durationSeconds` (default 5).
- Resolution: 480p, 720p (default), or 1080p. Ark encodes 1080p output as 10-bit H.265/HEVC.
- Ratio: `16:9`, `4:3`, `1:1`, `3:4`, `9:16`, `21:9`, or adaptive for locked frame/edit/extend tasks.
- Output: mp4 by default; set `outputFormat: "mov"` for edit/extend work where color fidelity and audio continuity matter.
- Audio generation is always enabled. Control dialogue, music, ambience, and silence in the prompt.
- Native prompt/audio output languages include Chinese, English, Spanish, Indonesian, Malay, Thai, Arabic, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean.

## Inputs

| Channel           | Tool param   |                   Limit |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------: |
| Exact first frame | `firstFrame` |                       1 |
| Exact last frame  | `lastFrame`  | 1, requires first frame |
| Reference images  | `refImages`  |                      30 |
| Reference videos  | `refVideos`  |                      10 |
| Reference audios  | `refAudios`  |                      10 |

Video references must each be 2-30s and total at most 30s. Audio references must each be 2-30s and total at most 30s. The tool validates counts; check source durations before submitting when metadata is available.

Seedance 2.5 supports audio-only reference generation. A visual reference is not required when `refAudios` is the only input.

Frame mode and reference mode remain mutually exclusive. Do not combine `firstFrame`/`lastFrame` with any `refImages`/`refVideos`/`refAudios`.

Every media input must be a project asset ref from `read_project`, `asset://<id>`, or a same-project asset URL. Download external media to a readable local path and register it with Desktop `push_asset` first. Refer to inputs explicitly as `@Image1`, `@Video1`, and `@Audio1`, then immediately identify what each reference controls.

## Task Modes

The request shape and prompt determine the task:

| Intent               | Inputs                                      | Required controls                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Text generation      | prompt only                                 | chosen ratio and 4-30s duration             |
| Reference generation | any reference arrays                        | chosen ratio and 4-30s duration             |
| First frame          | `firstFrame`                                | ratio becomes adaptive; 4-30s               |
| First/last frame     | both frame params                           | ratio becomes adaptive; 4-30s               |
| Video edit           | source in `refVideos`, `taskMode: "edit"`   | source duration is inherited; output is new |
| Video extend         | source in `refVideos`, `taskMode: "extend"` | set extension duration; output is new       |

The upstream model classifies edit and extend intent from the prompt. Use explicit wording such as "Edit @Video1...", "Replace...", "Remove...", "Extend @Video1 forward...", or "Continue @Video1...". Do not accidentally use edit/extend language for a semantic reference-only request.

For edits, Seedance locks ratio and duration to the source. `submit_video` sends `ratio: "adaptive"` and `duration: -1`; edit sources must be 4-30s. For extensions it sends adaptive ratio and the requested `durationSeconds`. Both paths default to MOV and always create a new generated asset; the original is unchanged.

## Prompt Structure

Write as a director, not as a keyword list:

1. Map every input to its role.
2. Give a one-sentence subject + setting + event + style overview.
3. Describe the sequence with integer-second timestamps for longer clips.
4. Specify shot size, camera movement, action, performance, lighting, dialogue, music, and sound effects where they matter.
5. End with global continuity and negative constraints.

Use continuous timestamp ranges without gaps, for example `0-5s`, `5-12s`, `12-20s`. Do not overpack a time range; the model will omit or over-cut impossible action density.

For many references, list mappings before the narrative:

```text
References: @Image1 is the hero product; @Video1 supplies camera motion only; @Audio1 supplies rhythm and vocal tone.
0-6s: ...
6-14s: ...
14-20s: ...
No subtitles. Keep the product geometry and label unchanged throughout.
```

Negative audio instructions are supported: "no BGM", "ambient sound only", "no dialogue", or "no sound". Say "no subtitles" when generated text is unwanted.

## Consistency

- Reuse the same image anchors across every shot that shares a person, product, or scene.
- Carry the latest approved video in `refVideos` when motion/style continuity matters.
- Explain what to copy from each reference; do not ask the model to copy every property unless that is intended.
- After two text-only retries for identity drift, stop and add or replace a visual anchor.

## Content Review

Raw references containing real people may be rejected. Prefer authorized portrait assets or eligible trusted outputs. If content review rejects an input, surface the failure and ask for a different/authorized reference; do not blindly retry the same media.

## Example

```ts
submit_video({
  model: "seedance-2-5",
  name: "Twenty-second launch film",
  durationSeconds: 20,
  ratio: "16:9",
  resolution: "720p",
  refImages: ["product-image-id"],
  refAudios: ["soundtrack-id"],
  prompt:
    "References: @Image1 is the exact hero product; @Audio1 controls rhythm. 0-6s: macro reveal... 6-14s: orbit... 14-20s: final packshot. Preserve product geometry and label. No subtitles.",
});
```
